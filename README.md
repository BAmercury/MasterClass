My youtube playlist:
[Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWC_AgPbmiSTcPTEHKK6BMRWUQZDhQ2Ej)

This is a great pdf that goes over the entire span of modeling, simulation, and control (From classical to modern) systems:
[Control System Master Guide](https://file.tavsys.net/control/state-space-guide.pdf)

Brian Douglas posts some great Khan Academy-like tutorials on control theory and design techniques
[Brian Douglas Control Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq0imsn84ShAe9PBOFnoIrg)

And MATLAB tech talks (By Brian Douglas again):

If you have a better handle on Linear Algebra and Differential Equations you can check out this playlist for modern control fundamentals:
[Control BootCamp](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMrJAkhIeNNR20Mz-VpzgfQs5zrYi085m)

This website is a great resource that takes you through various problems, shows you how to model them with mechanics/differential equations, and design controllers/implement them using MATLAB/Simulink. This website is great because it also shows you how to design controllers using both classical and modern techniques:
[Control Examples](http://ctms.engin.umich.edu/CTMS/index.php?example=Introduction&section=SystemModeling)

This website also has hardware examples on Arduino:

# ROS Tutorials

## ROS Kinetic
Follow this [ROS Installation Guide](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation)
Remember to perform the **desktop-full installation**

When you are finished installing, you will need to configure your work space. Follow: [Workspace Setup](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment)

Remember to source your setup.bash files (You will need to source these files anytime you open a new terminal window and you would want to perform rosrun/roslaunch commands to start up your ROS code:

    source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
    source devel/setup.bash
